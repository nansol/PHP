Playground: chess board
Create a chess board using two inline for loops within each other.

The board has 8 rows, each with 8 squares. The first row begins with a white square, the second with a black square.

Each square will have a class white or black.

You can use the following HTML & CSS:

.board .row {
    overflow: hidden;
}
.board .row > div {
    float: left;
    width: 3em;
    height: 3em;
}
.board .black {
    background-color: #000000;
}
<div class="board">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="white"></div>
        <div class="black"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="black"></div>
        <div class="white"></div>
    </div>
</div>
Remember that a number is even when it's modulus of 2 is 0 and odd when it's modulus of 2 is 1.

When you think you're done, find any way to add this king to field B-4:
